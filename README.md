<h1 id="motivation">Motivation ‚úÖ</h1>

- To compile a dictionary of one-letter keywords used to launch Alfred workflows. 
- To check for overlap with a custom list of system-wide hotkeys 

You can launch Alfred Workflows using single letters (either alone, or with a prefix, or as hotkeys with modifiers), specifically:

1. single-letter keyword (e.g. `m` used for `m query`)
2. prefix + single letter keyword (e.g. `k` used with a prefix (`!`, -> `!k`) to search your Kindle library using `alfred-kindle`)
3. hotkey (a letter plus one or more of the modifier keys):
	1. 	Shift (‚áß)
	2. Control (^)
	3. Option (‚å•)
	4. Command (‚åò)

	
`Alfred's Alphabet`	allows to review single-letter shortcuts in a single dictionary application, to check which letters are used, which are available, and which ones are conflicting with system-wide shortcuts. 


<h1 id="usage">Basic Usage üìñ</h1>

## Browsing Alfred's Alphabet
- launch with keyword (default: `aalpha`), or custom hotkey
- scroll results or enter a single letter to filter. The first output is an overview with one circle per keyword/hotkey. 
- ‚ö™: unused prefix/hotkey modifier
-  üü†: prefix/hotkey modifier used for Alfred Workflow
-  üî¥: used prefix/hotkey modifier, conflicting with one of the custom/system-wide shortcuts
- Circles are grouped in blocks as follows:
	1. no prefix (i.e. single-letter keyword)
	2. prefix block (if any): if any letter prefixes have been entered in `Workflow configuration`, they will be represented in this block (one circle per prefix)
	3. 1-key modifier keys in this order (block of 4): `shift`, `control`, `option`, `command`
	4. 2-key modifier keys: 
		- block of 3: `sht-ctl`, `sht-opt`, `sht-cmd`
		- block of 2: `ctl-opt`, `ctl-cmd`
		- block of 1: `opt-cmd`
	5. 3-key modifier keys (block of 3): `sht-ctl-opt`, `sht-ctl-cmd`, `ctl-opt-cmd`,
	6. 4-key modifier (block of 1): `sht-ctl-opt-cmd`
- `ctrl-enter` `^`‚Ü©Ô∏è will show the overview in large font
- `enter` ‚Ü©Ô∏è will list the workflows using that letter
- further pressing `enter` ‚Ü©Ô∏è will open the config page of the corresponding Workflow. 

## Saving custom hotkeys
- By entering `:aalpha` you can open a `csv` file with custom hotkeys. 
- Enter your own, using for the modifier key one of the abbreviations listed above. 
- A few examples are listed as demo in the default file. 


<h1 id="setting-up">Setting up ‚öôÔ∏è</h1>

- Alfred 5 with Powerpack license
- Python3 (howto [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/python-version-on-mac-update/))
- Download `alfred-alphabet` [latest release](https://github.com/giovannicoppola/alfred-alphabet/releases/latest)



## Default settings 
- In Alfred, open the 'Configure Workflow' menu in `alfred-alphabet` preferences
	- *Optional*: set the keyword for the workflow (default: `aalpha`)
	- *Optional*: set a hotkey for the workflow
	- *Optional*: enter letter prefixes (one or more characters), separated by space, e.g. `! @ aa` for the prefixes `!`, `@`, and `aa`. 
	- *Optional*: check the `Include Disabled Workflows` checkbox if you want to include disabled Workflows





<h1 id="known-issues">Limitations & known issues ‚ö†Ô∏è</h1>

- Alfred allows to restrict the scope of a hotkey (for example a hotkey may work only if a specific application has focus). `Alfred-alphabet` will not include this in the output, or in determining conflicts. 
- None for now, but I have not done extensive testing, let me know if you see anything!
